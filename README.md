## Breaktivity

This app was written for the React Native Boston meetup to give an overview of what its like to get started building an app in React Native. As such, consider this as a real world starting point, it's not nearly production ready yet.

### Current Issues
- [ ] This only works while the app is open right now
- [ ] There is a little bit of jumpiness when adjusting the sliders

### Future Plans
- [ ] Bring iOS up to parity with android code
- [ ] Save work / break stats
- [ ] Ask the user for feedback on the cycle: 😀 / 😐 / 😢 / 😠
- [ ] Improve the movement detection
- [ ] Improve the design
- [ ] Release to the app stores

I'd love PRs or improvement suggestions!
